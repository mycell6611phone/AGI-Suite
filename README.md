# AGI-Suite
AGI Agent Platform
🚀 Boundless Modular AGI Agent Platform

The Next-Gen, Open Architecture for Autonomous AI Agents
🌐 Vision

“What if you could build an agent that never forgets, reasons about its own choices, learns from every mistake, adapts its personality, and controls real-world systems—all with open, modular code?”

This project is a blueprint and working prototype for that vision:
A research-grade AGI agent framework with layered memory, tool/plugin ecosystem, metacognition, continual learning, observability, human-in-the-loop safety, and full environmental embodiment.
🏗️ Architecture Overview

    Boundless, Layered Memory Fabric
    Unlimited, hierarchical memory—combining vector search, on-disk storage, and active forgetting/refresh.

    Plugin & Toolbelt System
    Native runtime plugins for code execution, DB, web, APIs, and drag-and-drop pipeline composition.

    Metacognitive Core
    Self-reflective planner with rationale tracing, critique, and quantified uncertainty/confidence.

    Mood & Persona Manager
    Runtime-switchable personas and moods, goal-aligned for adaptive, contextual behavior.

    Continual Self-Learning
    Online feedback (upvotes/downvotes) flows into lightweight adapters or RL modules for real-time improvement.

    Observability & Telemetry
    Live dashboards, metrics, trace logs—every agent step is auditable.

    Human-in-the-Loop Harmony
    Clarification and escalation protocols to ensure safe, interpretable autonomy.

    Pluggable Policy Engine
    Modular enforcement of privacy, bias, compliance, and safety at runtime.

    Multi-Modal & Environmental Embodiment
    Adapters for text, image, audio, code, sensors, and action executors (Docker, SSH, K8s, IoT).

    Adaptive, Self-Healing Scheduling
    Central orchestrator with hook-based workflow, fallback/recovery, and live tuning.

🧩 Module Breakdown
Module/Folder	Description

feedback_trainer	Online feedback, continual LoRA/adapters, data curation
metrics_observability	Live dashboards, metrics, trace logs, audit
human_in_loop	Clarification, escalation, human-in-the-loop safety
policy_manager	Privacy, bias, compliance enforcement, modular policy plugins
multi_modal	Sensor adapters, action executors, event fusion/workflows
scheduler	Central loop, hook registry, every-n-loops, self-healing logic
main.py	Demo entrypoint: wires up all modules for turnkey run
💡 Features

    Plug in new skills, tools, and adapters at runtime—no core changes required

    “Never forgets”—memory, context, and learning are infinite and always retrievable

    Transparent, auditable decision-making: every action, every thought, fully logged

    Handles errors, ambiguity, and failures with self-healing and human escalation

    Fully modular: swap out or extend any part—run as agent, service, or headless API

🚦 Quick Start

git clone https://github.com/mycell6611phone/AGI-Suite.git
cd modular-agi
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
# See README for module demos and config

    Demo workflows and adapters: See /multi_modal/workflows/

    Customize modules and policies: Edit /policy_manager/policy_config.yaml

    Metrics: View live dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana setup in /metrics_observability/)

🎓 Why Is This Different?

    Beyond chatbots: This is not just a wrapper for GPT or an LLM with plugins. It’s a real agent platform with real memory, real reasoning, real learning, and real-world action capabilities.

    Truly modular: Every major AI/agent system is a pluggable module, not just a monolith or hard-coded pipeline.

    Enterprise/Research ready: Human-in-the-loop, audit, policy, and observability from day one.
